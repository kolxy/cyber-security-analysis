# Cyber Security Dataset Analysis Project

Our goals are two-fold. We wish to perform matrix profiling on a dataset and compare its efficacy to conventional anomaly detection techniques, and test auto-encoders and compare their dimensionality reduction efficacy with PCA. 

## Setup
Modules and versions
```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data Source

We are currently using [Nour Moustafa and Jill Slay](https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/plus/index.php/s/2DhnLGDdEECo4ys?path=%2FUNSW-NB15%20-%20CSV%20Files) NUSW-NB15 dataset, which contains a lot of labeled cybersecurity data.
