# Cyber Security Dataset Analysis Project

Our goals are two-fold. We wish to perform anomaly detection on a time series type cybersecurity dataset using a variety of methods such as matrix profiling, MLP, logistic regression, ensemble methods, and compare their efficacy (and see if matrix profiling is any use on this kind of dataset), and test auto-encoders and compare their dimensionality reduction efficacy with PCA. 

## Setup
Modules and versions
```bash
$ python -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data Source

We are currently using [Nour Moustafa and Jill Slay](https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/plus/index.php/s/2DhnLGDdEECo4ys?path=%2FUNSW-NB15%20-%20CSV%20Files) NUSW-NB15 dataset, which contains a lot of labeled cybersecurity data.
